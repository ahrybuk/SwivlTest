# SwivlTest

<b>Technology stack:</b>

1) Kotlin - main android language now;
2) Retrofit2 - most powerfull and convinient lib for networking.
3) RxJava2 - good for reactive way of programming. 
4) Koin - good lib for DI. Not so heavy, as Dagger2 (there is no need to use huge Dagger2 lib for test project)


<b>About architecture:</b>

I decide to use some kind of "simple" architecture, because there are no benefits to use MVP or clean architecture for 2 screens.
